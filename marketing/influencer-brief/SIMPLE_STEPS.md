# Simple Steps to Find Your Best TikTok Videos

## Step 1: Open Your TikTok Account
1. Go to https://www.tiktok.com/@godgpt_ in your browser
2. Scroll through your videos
3. Look for videos that stand out to you

## Step 2: Pick Videos That Look Good (Simple Version)

You don't need to calculate exact percentages. Just look for videos that:

### ✅ Look for These Things:

**1. Videos with lots of engagement:**
- Many likes (relative to views)
- Comments from viewers
- Shares or saves

**2. Videos that show GodGPT clearly:**
- The app is visible
- Brand name is mentioned/shown
- Product is featured prominently

**3. Videos that feel authentic:**
- Real people sharing real experiences
- Genuine reactions
- Not overly scripted or fake

**4. Videos that match your content types:**

**Personal Stories** - People talking about:
- Their dating life
- Personal struggles
- Spiritual moments
- Life experiences using GodGPT

**Reviews** - People sharing:
- Their experience with GodGPT
- What they liked/discovered
- Results they got
- Honest feedback

**How-To** - People showing:
- How to use the app
- Step-by-step tutorials
- Features walkthroughs
- Navigation guides

## Step 3: Make a Simple List

Just write down:
- Video URL (copy the link from TikTok)
- What type it is (Personal Story, Review, or How-To)
- Why you like it (one sentence)

Example:
```
Video 1: https://www.tiktok.com/@godgpt_/video/1234567890
Type: Personal Story
Why: Great authentic moment, shows dating use case

Video 2: https://www.tiktok.com/@godgpt_/video/0987654321
Type: Review
Why: Clear review, good engagement
```

## Step 4: Pick Your Top 6

Aim for:
- 2-3 Personal Stories
- 2-3 Reviews  
- 1-2 How-To videos

That's it! You don't need to calculate percentages or score anything. Just pick videos that:
- Look good
- Show GodGPT
- Feel authentic
- Have decent engagement

## What If You Don't Have Analytics?

**No problem!** Just use your eyes:

1. **Look at the numbers:**
   - Videos with more likes/comments are usually better
   - If a video has 10K views and 500 likes, that's good
   - If a video has 10K views and 50 likes, maybe skip it

2. **Check the comments:**
   - Positive comments = good sign
   - People asking questions = engagement
   - Negative or controversial = skip it

3. **Trust your gut:**
   - If a video feels right, it probably is
   - If it represents your brand well, include it
   - If you'd want to show it to a new creator, it's a good example

## Quick Checklist (Just Check These Off)

For each video you're considering:

- [ ] Shows GodGPT clearly
- [ ] Looks professional/good quality
- [ ] Has decent engagement (likes/comments)
- [ ] Feels authentic
- [ ] Matches one of your content types
- [ ] You'd be proud to show it as an example

If you can check 4+ boxes, it's probably a good choice!
